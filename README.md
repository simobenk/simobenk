### 🧭 About
Final-year **AI Engineering student @ CentraleSupélec** — exploring the intersection of **retrieval, reasoning, and generation**.  
I build systems that **learn from context**, **adapt to ambiguity**, and **act intelligently**.  
My work sits between applied research and engineering — taking ideas from theory to working, deployable systems.
