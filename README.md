### 👋 About Me
My name is Mohamed BENKIRANE, I am an engineering student at CentraleSupélec specializing in Computer Science and Machine Learning. I build systems that **learn from context**, **adapt to ambiguity**, and **act intelligently**. My work sits between applied research and engineering, taking ideas from theory to working, deployable systems.
