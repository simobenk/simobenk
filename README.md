## 🤖 Mohamed Benkirane

Final-year **AI Engineering student at CentraleSupélec**, driven by curiosity, computation, and creativity.  
I build systems that *understand, retrieve, and generate* — models that don’t just predict, but **reason**.  

I’ve explored the boundaries of intelligence across research, hackathons, and applied AI projects — from multimodal systems to large-scale language models.  
Here’s a glimpse of what I’ve built so far 👇  

---

### 🚧 Currently Building
🌌 **Retrieval-Augmented Systems & AI Agents**  
Developing architectures that merge **reasoning and retrieval**, using LLMs, embeddings, and contextual pipelines to make models think with knowledge.  

---

### 🧠 Previously Built
🏆 **MediAssist (1st Prize – HackAI Morocco 2025)**  
Multimodal AI assistant combining **radiology image encoders (ALBEF)**, **FAISS retrieval**, and **OpenAI LLMs** for **personalized radiology reports**.  
Includes **Darija TTS fine-tuning** and **sign-language video synthesis** to enhance accessibility.

⚛️ **Hydrogen Storage Prediction**  
Trained and benchmarked **Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks** on **80K+ material samples**, achieving **91.4% accuracy**, outperforming published baselines.

🧩 **Sequential Document Classifier**  
Built an NLP pipeline with **semantic chunking**, **embedding generation**, and **Seq2Seq / LSTM models**, reaching **90% F1-score** for document automation.

🪶 **Karnote Multimodal Retrieval (Innovation Award 2024)**  
Created a **cross-modal search engine** linking handwritten notes, PDFs, and transcripts through **BERT embeddings** and **Gemini summarization fusion**.

💡 **Customer Segmentation System (ThinkOne Research)**  
Designed a **PCA + K-Means** pipeline (silhouette score 0.82) and **LLM-based anonymization system** with **Mistral-7B**, reducing manual processing by 40%.

### 🧭 What I Believe
> *AI isn’t just about automating thought — it’s about expanding what thought can be.*

Every project I build aims to make intelligence **more transparent, accessible, and aligned with human creativity**.

### ✨ Closing Thought
> “The future of AI isn’t building smarter machines — it’s building machines that make *us* smarter.”
